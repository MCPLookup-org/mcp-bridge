# TODO: Fix TypeScript Compilation Issues

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ GitHub repo created: https://github.com/MCPLookup-org/mcp-bridge
- ‚úÖ Package structure complete
- ‚ùå TypeScript compilation errors need fixing

## Issues to Fix

### 1. MCP SDK Compatibility
The bridge files were copied from the main repo but have compatibility issues with the MCP SDK version in package.json.

### 2. Tool Registration Syntax
The `server.tool()` method signature has changed in newer MCP SDK versions.

### 3. Type Definitions
Some type definitions are missing or incompatible.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Update MCP SDK Version
Update package.json to use the same MCP SDK version as the main repo.

### Option B: Fix Tool Registration
Update the tool registration syntax to match the current MCP SDK version.

### Option C: Copy Working Files
Copy the exact working files from the main repo with their dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix compilation errors**
2. **Test the build** with `npm run build`
3. **Publish to npm** with `npm publish`
4. **Update main repo** to use the npm package
